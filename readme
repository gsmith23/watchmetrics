A program for comparing watchman fill cocktails
using performance metrics.

How to run

Firstly you have to have output files from 
rat stored in a watchmakers folder naming 
convention - see GetFilePath() 

Note that gStyle is set using 
https://github.com/Watchman-PMT/Wavedump_Wrapper/blob/master/Common_Tools/wmStyle.C
by default so you will need this file or to comment out the lines where it is used.

$ root
root [0] .L watchmetrics.cc+
root [1] watchmetrics()
or see the options in watchmetrics.cc
